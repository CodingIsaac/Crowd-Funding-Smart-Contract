This is a simple crowd funding smart contract.

This is the basic idea, I desire to create a decentralized crowd funding smart contract.

Which eill have an admin who regulated the goal, and the deadline of the crowd funding.

There after transfers the sum to the desired rescipient.

The crowd funding has an only owner modifier to ensre that only the admin can start the crowd funding.

So, it's very basic and easy to understand.
